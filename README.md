# üêç Python Crash Course

Welcome to the **Python Crash Course** project! This repository is a comprehensive guide designed to help you master the fundamentals of Python programming. The project is structured into multiple chapters, each focusing on different core aspects of Python. Whether you're a beginner or looking to refresh your Python skills, this project has you covered.

## üìÇ Project Structure

The project is organized into the following key directories:

### 1. `src/` - Source Code

This directory contains all the main code, organized into chapters:

- **c01/**: Chapter 1 - _Getting Started_
- **c02/**: Chapter 2 - _Variables and Simple Data Types_
- **c03/**: Chapter 3 - _Introducing Lists_
- **c04/**: Chapter 4 - _Working with Lists_
- **c05/**: Chapter 5 - _if Statements_
- **c06/**: Chapter 6 - _Dictionaries_
- **c07/**: Chapter 7 - _User Input and while Loops_
- **c08/**: Chapter 8 - _Functions_
- **c09/**: Chapter 9 - _Classes_
- **c10/**: Chapter 10 - _Files and Exceptions_
- **c11/**: Chapter 11 - _Testing Your Code_

Additionally, there is a **data/** folder within `src/` that stores all the data used across various chapters.

### 2. `tests/` - Unit Tests

This directory contains the `pytest` unit tests for the project, particularly related to **Chapter 11: Testing Your Code**. These tests ensure that the code written in `src/c11/` is functioning correctly.
